Aryabhata (476‚Äì550 CE) was one of the greatest mathematicians and astronomers of ancient India. </br>
He made significant contributions to mathematics and science, and his works are highly regarded even today.</br>

<p><b>Key Information About Aryabhata</b></br>
<b>1. Early Life</b></br></br>

Birth: Aryabhata was born in 476 CE in Kusumapura (modern-day Patna, Bihar, India).</br>
Education: He is believed to have studied at Nalanda University, a prominent center of learning at the time.</br>

<b>2. Major Works</b></br></br>

Aryabhata wrote several works, but his most famous is the Aryabhatiya, a comprehensive text on mathematics and astronomy, written in Sanskrit.</br>
The Aryabhatiya consists of 121 verses divided into four sections:</br>
Gitikapada - Large units of time, including planetary revolutions.</br>
Ganitapada - Mathematical concepts and calculations.</br>
Kalakriyapada - Calendrical calculations.</br>
Golapada - Spherical astronomy.</br>

<b>3. Contributions to Mathematics</b></br>

Place Value System and Zero: Aryabhata used the concept of zero in his place value system, which was later refined in Indian mathematics.</br>
Approximation of Pi (œÄ): Aryabhata calculated the value of pi as </br>
         ùúã ‚âà 3.1416</br>
œÄ‚âà3.1416, stating that it is an irrational number.</br>

Trigonometry: He introduced trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and their relationships.</br>
Algebra: He solved quadratic equations and discussed indeterminate equations.</br>

<b>4. Contributions to Astronomy</b></br>

Aryabhata proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis, explaining the apparent movement of stars.</br>
He accurately calculated the duration of a day as 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds.</br>
He explained lunar and solar eclipses scientifically, attributing them to the shadows cast by Earth and the Moon.</br>

<b>5. Legacy</b></br>

Aryabhata's contributions influenced later Indian mathematicians such as Brahmagupta and Bhaskara.</br>
His works were translated into Arabic and influenced Islamic and European scholars.</br>
India's first satellite, Aryabhata, launched in 1975, was named in his honor.</br>

<b>Interesting Facts</b></br>

Aryabhata referred to himself as a "Kusumapura resident," hinting at the city being a hub for learning.</br>
He explained that the moon and planets shine because they reflect sunlight, an idea far ahead of his time.</br>
His system of denoting large numbers was innovative, using Sanskrit letters to represent digits.</br>

<b>Conclusion</b></br>

Aryabhata‚Äôs groundbreaking contributions laid the foundation for many mathematical and astronomical concepts. </br>
His works showcase the brilliance of ancient Indian science and continue to inspire mathematicians and scientists worldwide.</br>
